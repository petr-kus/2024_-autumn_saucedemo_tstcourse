    # Lector's TIP: Parameterizing the test enhances reusability across various test scenarios, offering greater flexibility and reducing code duplication.
    # TIP: While designing test parameterization, consider the knowledge and expectations of the end user for input data. This user-centric approach improves abstraction from a technical perspective.
    # TIP: Technical details of parameterization should be abstracted and encapsulated within the POM to maintain clean and readable test code.

        # Lector's TIP: Use full descriptive variable and method names with 'snake_case' convention for clarity.
        # Lector's TIP: The test steps are broken into multiple lines (variables first_page_items, random_item) for better readability and to clearly reflect the flow of actions.
        # Lector's TIP: Tests should be self-explanatory and readable without requiring extra documentation or technical knowledge.
        # Lector's note: This readability is achieved through descriptive naming, modular steps, POM, OOP, and a clear logical flowâ€”not dependent on specific tools or frameworks (it is style of thinking).

        # Principle: The main tests or test scenarios should be written in a way that is clear and readable, 
        # making it obvious what is being tested and how, even without technical knowledge.
        # Lector's note: This approach is not just for non-technical roles (a common misconception) 
        # but also to facilitate quick debugging and human understanding, even for those with strong programming skills.
        # Reminder: Writing a test usually takes less time than reading and maintaining it later. Tests are more time readed than written!
